Attachment
==========

Supported by Redmine starting from version 1.3

Manager
-------

All operations on the Attachment resource are provided by its manager. To get access to it
you have to call ``redmine.attachment`` where ``redmine`` is a configured redmine object.
See the :doc:`../configuration` about how to configure redmine object.

Create methods
--------------

Not supported by Redmine. Some resources support adding attachments via their create/update methods, e.g. Issue, WikiPage.
