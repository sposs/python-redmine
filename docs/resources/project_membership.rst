Project Membership
==================

Supported by Redmine starting from version 1.4

Manager
-------

All operations on the ProjectMembership resource are provided by its manager. To get access to
it you have to call ``redmine.project_membership`` where ``redmine`` is a configured redmine object.
See the :doc:`../configuration` about how to configure redmine object.
